<h1>FARMER THE UNSUNG HERO</h1>
<h3> farmer is no less than a god on Earth for it is through his hands that life is sustained.<br> He toils day and night, facing the harshness of the sun, the unpredictability of rain,<br> and the weight of endless labor ‚Äî all to feed millions who may never know his name. <br>Like a silent guardian, he nurtures the soil, sows hope in the form of seeds, and harvests<br> not just crops but life itself. <br>Without the farmer, plates would be empty and lives uncertain, yet he asks for nothing<br> but dignity and a fair return In his humility<br> sacrifice, and service to humanity, the farmer stands as a living embodiment of creation<br> and care ‚Äî a true god among men.
   <br> <br> A farmer often suffers silently under the weight of unpredictable weather, financial burdens, and hard physical labor. Despite working long hours in the sun and rain to grow food for others, they frequently face crop failures due to droughts, floods, or pests. Low market prices for their produce, rising costs of seeds and fertilizers, and debts from loans can leave them in severe financial distress. In many parts of the world, lack of government support, poor access to healthcare, and isolation add to their struggles. While their work is essential, the farmer‚Äôs life is often filled with uncertainty, hardship, and sacrifice.
